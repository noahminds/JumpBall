# JumpBall DevLog
## Preliminary Game Design
- **Game Concept**: A 2D platformer where the player controls a red ball that can jump to reach the goal.
- **Game Mechanics**:
    - The player can move the ball left and right.
    - The player can jump the ball.
    - The camera pans with the movement of the ball within the scene.
    - The player can restart the level by pressing the R key.
- **Level Design**:
    - The initial plan is to build a single level.
    - The level will include moving platforms that the ball can use to reach the objective (a flag post).
    - There will be obstacles such as spikes.
    - Spikes can result in a game over condition where the big red ball breaks into a couple of small red balls, and the game over screen flashes up.
#### Aesthetic Goals
- **Simplicity**: The game should have a simple and clean design. The red ball has a black line to help indicate the direction of movement. The ground will have a simple grass sprite in places to add aesthetic appeal.
- **Success Indicators**: Players progress the ball towards the clearly marked flag post. When they reach the objective a sucess screen flashes up with the option to play again.
